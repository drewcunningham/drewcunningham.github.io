Greetings! Welcome to my website. 

A little bit about me:
- I am a library clerk at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and a proud member of the United Library Workers union. 
- Before working at CLP, I worked as a circulation assistant at my college's library. 
- In January 2022, I will enter Clarion University's Master of Science in Information and Library Science (M.S.L.S.) program, expecting to graduate in late 2023. Thereafter, I'd like to be a librarian.
- I am interested both in the front-facing, service-oriented aspects of librarianship as well as in cataloging and collections analysis + development. 
- I hope to be able to undertake and publish critical research in the field of library and information science (L.I.S.), drawing on my previous academic forays into structures of identity and building on the insights of abolition politics. 
- I want to make libraries better spaces for people who have been traditionally excluded and underserved by them and, by extension, for everybody. I'd love to work with and learn from those who are trying to do the same.
- I was selected to travel to Leipzig, Germany, as a 2020-2021 Fulbright English Teaching Assistant (ETA), though, after defering to 2021-2022, I elected not to participate owing to the ongoing pandemic. 
- I have reading knowledge of German and basic conversational fluency.
- In my free time, I talk about books and other stuff with my friends. I like to visit museums, parks, and urban trails, on which I sometimes run. In non-Covid times, I was an enthusiastic traveler. I hope to visit new places again soon!
- I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Education:

- M.S.L.S., Clarion University of Pennsylvania [expected 2023]
- B.A. *magna cum laude* in English (with high honors), Haverford College [2020]
