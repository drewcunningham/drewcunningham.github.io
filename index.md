Hello, 

### Welcome to my website!
 
 
Here is a bit of my educational background: I graduated from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/english) in May 2020 with a B.A. in English and with minors in German and philosophy. In my final year, I wrote a thesis, “‘This Intolerable Incubus’: The Melancholia of ‘Bartleby, the Scrivener’,” in which I examined the complex relationship between the lawyer-narrator and Bartleby, one of American literature's most puzzled over figures. During my third year, I studied abroad in Berlin and anticipate, now, spending more time in Germany with [Fulbright ETA](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/types-of-awards/english-teaching-assistant-awards) (English Teaching Assistantship), though, unfortunately, the program has been delayed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, until at least January 2021. In the meantime, I have begun the process of applying to graduate schools to further my study of literature, in particular, American literature of the nineteenth century, using psychoanalytic and committedly relational (re)framings of gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity.
 
In 2018, I conducted some research for and curated an exhibit within Haverford College’s (then) newly opened [VCAM](https://www.haverford.edu/visual-culture-arts-and-media) with support from the English department, the John B. Hurford ’60 Center for the Arts and Humanities, as well as the Office of the Provost. The exhibit, entitled [“The Lynching of Zachariah Walker: A Local Legacy,”](https://blogs.haverford.edu/decentered/2018/10/25/preparing-for-the-legacy-of-lynching-an-interview-with-drew-cunningham-20/) was opened in conjunction with the [“Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America”](https://exhibits.haverford.edu/thelegacyoflynching/about/) exhibit at the Cantor Fizgerald Gallery at Haverford.

I have experience as an educator, serving as a writing tutor for Haverford’s [MAST](https://www.haverford.edu/mast) program and as a teaching assistant for intermediate German.

Otherwise, I have worked in libraries and coffee shops, thus, in places where I also enjoy spending my free time writing, reading, and people watching.
